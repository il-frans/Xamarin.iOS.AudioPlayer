# Xamarin.iOS.AudioPlayer
An audio player which can handle streaming audio from a url or from disk

This project is heavily based on the swift Jukebox player found here https://github.com/teodorpatras/Jukebox

The initial work is a line by line translation from swift to Xamarin.iOS. Once the base version is stable, the project will be improved by making classes more abstracted and better fitting C# language.
